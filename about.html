                    <h2>Not Your Typical Mortgage Broker</h2>
                    <p>I got into this industry 11 years ago because I saw too many people getting bad advice—or no advice at all. They'd walk into their bank, take whatever rate was offered, and never realize they were leaving thousands of dollars on the table.</p>
                    <p>That didn't sit right with me.</p>
                    <p>So I became the person who fights on the other side. As a mortgage agent, I don't work for any single bank or lender. I work for you. My job is to shop your mortgage across dozens of lenders and find the best rate and terms for your specific situation.</p>

                    <h2>Why I Do This</h2>
                    <p>The best part of my job? Watching someone realize they just saved $15,000 over the life of their mortgage. Or helping a first-time buyer who thought they couldn't qualify finally get the keys to their home.</p>
                    <p>I'm also a mom of two, so I understand what's at stake. Your mortgage isn't just a financial product—it's your family's home. The place where your kids grow up. That's why I take this so seriously.</p>
                    <p>When I'm not working, you'll find me outside being active with my kids. I believe in balance, and I bring that same energy to how I work with clients: thorough but never overwhelming, professional but always human.</p>
