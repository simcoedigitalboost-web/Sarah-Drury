                    <h2>Your Orillia Mortgage Expert</h2>
                    <p>Orillia isn't just where I work—it's home. I understand this community because I'm part of it. When you work with me, you're getting someone who knows the local market, the neighborhoods, and what it takes to buy or own a home here.</p>
                    <p>Whether you're a first-time buyer looking at homes near the waterfront, a family upgrading to something bigger in West Orillia, or a homeowner looking to refinance—I can help you navigate the process with local insight that out-of-town brokers simply don't have.</p>

                    <h2>The Orillia Real Estate Market</h2>
                    <p>Orillia has seen significant growth over the past few years. More people are discovering what locals have always known: you can have waterfront living, small-town community, and easy access to everything—all without Toronto prices.</p>
                    <p>But growth means competition. When you find the right home, you need to move fast with confidence. That starts with having your mortgage sorted out before you start shopping.</p>

                    <h2>How I Help Orillia Homeowners</h2>
                    <p><strong>First-Time Buyers</strong><br>
                    Breaking into the Orillia market? I'll help you understand what you can afford, get pre-approved so sellers take you seriously, and find the best mortgage for your situation. <a href="../services/first-time-buyers.html">Learn more →</a></p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Mortgage Renewals</strong><br>
                    If you already own in Orillia and your renewal is coming up, don't just sign your bank's letter. Let me shop the market and make sure you're getting the best rate available. <a href="../services/renewals.html">Learn more →</a></p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Refinancing</strong><br>
                    Orillia home values have increased significantly. If you've been here a few years, you likely have equity you could put to work—renovations, debt consolidation, investment. <a href="../services/refinancing.html">Learn more →</a></p>

                    <h2>Surrounding Areas</h2>
                    <p>I also serve homeowners and buyers in the communities around Orillia:</p>

                    <h2>Why Work With a Local Agent?</h2>
                    <p>You could go to your bank. You could use some broker in Toronto you found online. But here's the difference:</p>
                    <p>I answer my phone. I meet in person when you need it. I'm not juggling hundreds of clients across the GTA—I'm focused on helping families right here in Orillia and Simcoe County get the best mortgages possible.</p>
                    <p>When something needs to happen fast, I'm here. When you have questions at 7pm, you can text me. That's what working with a local agent means.</p>
