        <h1>Mortgage Refinancing</h1>
        <p>Your home's equity is sitting there doing nothing. Let's put it to work.</p>

                    <h2>What Is Refinancing, Really?</h2>
                    <p>Refinancing means replacing your current mortgage with a new one—usually to access your home's equity, get a better rate, or change your terms. If your home is worth more than you owe, that difference is equity you can use.</p>
                    <p>Think of it this way: your home has been quietly building value while you make payments. Refinancing lets you tap into that value without selling your home.</p>

                    <h2>Why People Refinance</h2>
                    <p>There's no single reason to refinance—it depends on what you're trying to accomplish. Here are the most common situations I help clients with:</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Debt Consolidation</strong><br>
                    Credit cards, car loans, lines of credit—they all charge higher interest than a mortgage. If you're carrying high-interest debt, rolling it into your mortgage can dramatically reduce your monthly payments and total interest paid. One client saved over $800 a month by consolidating. That's not a typo.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Home Renovations</strong><br>
                    Want to renovate your kitchen, finish your basement, or add a deck? Instead of draining your savings or financing through a high-interest loan, refinancing lets you borrow against your home at mortgage rates. Plus, smart renovations can increase your home's value.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Investment Opportunities</strong><br>
                    Some homeowners use their equity to invest—whether that's buying a rental property, investing in the market, or starting a business. The interest on money borrowed for investment purposes may even be tax-deductible. (Talk to your accountant about the specifics.)</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Better Rate or Terms</strong><br>
                    If rates have dropped significantly since you got your mortgage, or if your financial situation has improved, you might qualify for a better deal. Even a small rate reduction can save thousands over the life of your mortgage.</p>

                    <h2>How Much Can You Access?</h2>
                    <p>In Canada, you can typically refinance up to 80% of your home's current value. So if your home is worth $500,000 and you owe $300,000, you could potentially access up to $100,000 in equity ($500,000 × 80% = $400,000 – $300,000 owed = $100,000).</p>
                    <p>The actual amount depends on your income, credit, and the current appraisal of your home. I can help you figure out exactly what's possible in your situation.</p>

                    <h2>The Costs to Consider</h2>
                    <p>Refinancing isn't free. Before you decide, we need to weigh the costs against the benefits:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Prepayment Penalty</strong> — If you're breaking your mortgage early, there may be a penalty. This is often the biggest cost, especially with fixed-rate mortgages.</li>
                        <li><strong>Legal Fees</strong> — You'll need a lawyer to register the new mortgage.</li>
                        <li><strong>Appraisal Fee</strong> — The lender needs to confirm your home's current value.</li>
                        <li><strong>Discharge Fee</strong> — Your current lender may charge a fee to discharge your existing mortgage.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Here's the thing: I'll calculate all of this for you upfront. Sometimes refinancing makes sense; sometimes it doesn't. I'll tell you honestly either way.</p>

                    <h2>When Refinancing Makes Sense</h2>
                    <p>Refinancing is usually a good idea when the savings or benefits significantly outweigh the costs. For example:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>You're paying 19% on credit card debt but could pay 5% on your mortgage</li>
                        <li>You need funds for renovations that will increase your home's value</li>
                        <li>Interest rates have dropped substantially since your original mortgage</li>
                        <li>Your financial situation has improved and you now qualify for better terms</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>When It Might Not Make Sense</h2>
                    <p>I'll be honest with you if refinancing isn't the right move:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The prepayment penalty wipes out your savings</li>
                        <li>You're close to renewal anyway (might be better to wait)</li>
                        <li>You don't have a clear plan for the funds</li>
                        <li>It would stretch your budget too thin</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>My job is to help you make the right decision, not just any decision.</p>

                    <h2>The Process</h2>
                    <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> We talk about your goals and run the numbers. What are you trying to accomplish? How much equity do you have? What would the costs be?</p>
                    <p><strong>Step 2:</strong> I shop for the best refinancing options across my network of lenders. Different lenders have different products and rates.</p>
                    <p><strong>Step 3:</strong> We compare the options and make a decision together. You'll know exactly what you're getting and what it costs.</p>
                    <p><strong>Step 4:</strong> I coordinate the paperwork, appraisal, and legal process. You sign, the funds flow, and your new mortgage is in place.</p>
