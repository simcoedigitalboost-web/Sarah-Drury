                    <h2>The Renewal Letter Trap</h2>
                    <p>Here's what happens to most homeowners: About four months before your term ends, your bank sends a renewal letter. It has a rate on it. Maybe it looks reasonable. You're busy. You sign it and send it back.</p>
                    <p>What you don't realize is that the rate on that letter is almost never the best rate available—even from your own bank. It's the rate they offer people who don't negotiate. People who don't shop around. People who make it easy for them.</p>
                    <p>Banks know that most people won't switch lenders. It's too much hassle, they think. So they offer you a mediocre rate and hope you'll just accept it.</p>

                    <h2>This Is Your Leverage Moment</h2>
                    <p>Renewal time is actually your best opportunity to save money. Here's why:</p>
                    <p>At renewal, you can switch lenders with no penalty. Your term is ending anyway. You're free to shop the market, and every lender wants your business. That competition works in your favor—if you use it.</p>
                    <p>Even if you don't want to switch, showing your current bank that you have better offers gives you negotiating power. Banks have retention departments whose job is to keep you. They have better rates than what's in that letter. They just don't offer them unless you ask.</p>

                    <h2>What I Do for Renewal Clients</h2>
                    <p><strong>Shop the Market</strong><br>
                    I take your renewal to multiple lenders and get real quotes. We're not guessing what's out there—we know exactly what options you have.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Negotiate With Your Current Lender</strong><br>
                    If you want to stay with your bank, I can often get them to match or beat the competition. Having competing offers changes the conversation.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Review Your Terms</strong><br>
                    Rate isn't everything. What about prepayment privileges? Portability? Payment flexibility? I make sure your new mortgage fits your life, not just your budget.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Handle the Switch (If Needed)</strong><br>
                    If switching lenders makes sense, I coordinate the entire process. It's usually simpler than people expect—and often costs nothing out of pocket.</p>

                    <h2>The Numbers Matter</h2>
                    <p>Let's be specific about what's at stake. On a $400,000 mortgage:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>A 0.25% rate difference = roughly $1,000/year or $5,000 over a 5-year term</li>
                        <li>A 0.50% rate difference = roughly $2,000/year or $10,000 over a 5-year term</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>That's not theoretical. That's money that either goes to the bank or stays in your pocket. A 30-minute conversation with me could literally save you thousands.</p>

                    <h2>When to Start</h2>
                    <p>Ideally, reach out 4-6 months before your renewal date. This gives us time to:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Review your current mortgage</li>
                        <li>Shop the market properly</li>
                        <li>Negotiate without rushing</li>
                        <li>Complete paperwork if you're switching</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>That said, if your renewal is next month, call me anyway. Something is better than nothing.</p>

                    <h2>Already Signed? It Might Not Be Too Late</h2>
                    <p>Many renewal agreements have a 30-day window before they're locked in. If you just signed something and you're having second thoughts, get in touch immediately. We might still have options.</p>

                    <h2>Why Most People Don't Do This</h2>
                    <p>I get it. Life is busy. When that renewal letter arrives, signing it and moving on feels easy. Shopping around feels like work.</p>
                    <p>But here's the thing: I do the work. You have one conversation with me, and I handle the rest. The shopping, the comparing, the negotiating—that's my job. Your job is to sign the best offer at the end.</p>
                    <p>The question is whether a 30-minute conversation is worth potentially saving $5,000 or $10,000. For most people, the answer is obvious.</p>
