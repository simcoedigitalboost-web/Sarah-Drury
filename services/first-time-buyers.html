                    <h2>Most First-Time Buyers Leave Money on the Table</h2>
                    <p>Here's what usually happens: you walk into a bank, they run some numbers, and they offer you a mortgage. You assume that's the best you can do. You sign. Done.</p>
                    <p>But here's what you don't see: there are grants, rebates, incentives, and programs specifically designed to help first-time buyers—and most people never hear about them. Between government programs, lender incentives, and tax breaks, you could be looking at <strong>$40,000 or more in savings</strong> over the life of your mortgage.</p>
                    <p>That's not an exaggeration. That's what happens when you know where to look.</p>

                    <h2>Programs You Need to Know About</h2>
                    
                    <div class="program-cards">
                        <div class="program-card">
                            <h4>First-Time Home Buyer Incentive</h4>
                            <p>The government provides 5-10% of your home's purchase price toward your down payment as a shared equity mortgage. This reduces your monthly payments without you having to save more upfront.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="program-card">
                            <h4>First Home Savings Account (FHSA)</h4>
                            <p>A tax-free savings account specifically for your down payment. Contributions are tax-deductible (like an RRSP) and withdrawals for your home are tax-free (like a TFSA). Best of both worlds.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="program-card">
                            <h4>Home Buyers' Plan (HBP)</h4>
                            <p>Withdraw up to $35,000 from your RRSP tax-free to put toward your down payment. Couples can each withdraw $35,000—that's $70,000 from your retirement savings to get into your home now.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="program-card">
                            <h4>Land Transfer Tax Rebate</h4>
                            <p>Ontario first-time buyers can get a rebate of up to $4,000 on land transfer tax. That's money back in your pocket at closing.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="program-card">
                            <h4>Down Payment Assistance Programs</h4>
                            <p>Various programs exist to help buyers who don't have a full down payment saved. I'll help you find out if you qualify and guide you through the application process.</p>

                        <div class="program-card">
                            <h4>Cash-Back Mortgages</h4>
                            <p>Some lenders offer cash back at closing—money you can use for moving costs, furniture, or immediate renovations. I know which lenders offer the best cash-back deals.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="program-card">
                            <h4>Home Warranty Programs</h4>
                            <p>Qualify for free home warranty coverage worth up to $10,000, protecting you against unexpected repairs in your first years of ownership.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="program-card">
                            <h4>New to Canada Program</h4>
                            <p>Recently immigrated? Special mortgage programs exist for newcomers with limited Canadian credit history. You can qualify with as little as 5% down.</p>
                        </div>
                    </div>

                    <h2>What I Actually Do for First-Time Buyers</h2>
                    <p>Beyond finding you the best rate (which I will), here's what working with me looks like:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Identify every program you qualify for</strong> — I'll go through your situation and make sure you're not missing any grants, rebates, or incentives</li>
                        <li><strong>Get you pre-approved</strong> — Know exactly what you can afford before you start house hunting, so you can move fast when you find the right place</li>
                        <li><strong>Explain the stress test</strong> — Current rules mean you have to qualify at a higher rate than you'll actually pay. I'll explain how this works and what it means for your budget</li>
                        <li><strong>Help with your credit score</strong> — If your score needs work, I'll give you specific tips to improve it before we apply</li>
                        <li><strong>Compare mortgage insurance options</strong> — Bank mortgage insurance vs. independent life insurance—there's a big difference, and I'll explain which makes sense for you</li>
                        <li><strong>Guide you through closing</strong> — The paperwork, the timing, the lawyer stuff—I handle the coordination so you don't have to stress</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Down Payment: What You Actually Need</h2>
                    <p>The 20% down payment myth stops a lot of people from even trying to buy. Here's the reality:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Under $500,000:</strong> Minimum 5% down</li>
                        <li><strong>$500,000 to $999,999:</strong> 5% on first $500K, 10% on the rest</li>
                        <li><strong>$1 million and up:</strong> 20% minimum</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>So for a $400,000 home, you could get in with $20,000 down. Combine that with the Home Buyers' Plan and down payment assistance programs, and homeownership might be closer than you think.</p>

                    <h2>Understanding the Stress Test</h2>
                    <p>You've probably heard about the mortgage stress test. Here's what it means: even if you're getting a mortgage at 5%, you have to prove you could afford payments at around 7% (the qualifying rate changes periodically).</p>
                    <p>This affects how much you can borrow. The good news? I can run these numbers for you before you start shopping, so you know your real budget—not what online calculators tell you.</p>

                    <h2>Credit Score: Where You Need to Be</h2>
                    <p>Most A-lenders want to see a credit score of at least 620-680. If you're below that, we still have options—but the best rates require good credit.</p>
                    <p>If your score needs work, don't worry. I'll give you specific, actionable tips to improve it. Sometimes a few months of targeted effort can make a significant difference in what rates you qualify for.</p>

                    <h2>The Process: Step by Step</h2>
                    <p><strong>Step 1: We Talk.</strong> Tell me about your situation—income, savings, goals, timeline. I'll give you an honest assessment of where you stand and what programs you qualify for.</p>
                    <p><strong>Step 2: Pre-Approval.</strong> I'll get you pre-approved so you know your exact budget. This also shows sellers you're serious when you make an offer.</p>
                    <p><strong>Step 3: House Hunting.</strong> You find the place you love. I'm here for questions along the way—how different prices affect your payments, what conditions mean for financing, etc.</p>
                    <p><strong>Step 4: Final Approval.</strong> Once your offer is accepted, we finalize everything. I handle the paperwork and lender communication.</p>
                    <p><strong>Step 5: You Get the Keys.</strong> Closing day. You're a homeowner. I make sure there are no surprises.</p>
