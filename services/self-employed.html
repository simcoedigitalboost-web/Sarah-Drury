        <h1>Self-Employed Mortgages</h1>
        <p>Business owners, freelancers, and contractors—getting a mortgage doesn't have to be a nightmare. I specialize in making it work.</p>

            <div class="content-grid">
                <div class="content-main">
                    <h2>The Self-Employed Challenge</h2>
                    <p>You run a successful business. You make good money. You pay your bills on time. But when you walk into a bank, they act like you're a risk.</p>
                    <p>Here's the problem: traditional lenders want to see T4s and steady paychecks. They don't understand how self-employment works. They look at your tax return—which your accountant has (legally) optimized to minimize taxes—and assume that's all you make.</p>
                    <p>Your declared income and your actual income are often two very different numbers. Banks don't always get that. I do.</p>

                    <h2>I Know How to Present Your File</h2>
                    <p>As a mortgage agent, I work with lenders who specialize in self-employed clients. More importantly, I know how to package your application in a way that makes sense to underwriters.</p>
                    <p>This might include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Stated income programs</strong> — Some lenders will work with your stated income rather than just your tax returns</li>
                        <li><strong>Bank statement programs</strong> — Showing consistent deposits over 12-24 months to demonstrate actual cash flow</li>
                        <li><strong>Add-backs</strong> — Accounting for business expenses that don't reflect your true earning power</li>
                        <li><strong>Business-for-self documentation</strong> — Presenting your business financials in the most favorable light</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Every self-employed situation is unique. I'll look at your specific circumstances and figure out the best approach.</p>

                    <h2>Who This Applies To</h2>
                    <p>If any of these describe you, self-employed mortgage solutions might be right for your situation:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Sole proprietors and independent contractors</li>
                        <li>Small business owners (incorporated or not)</li>
                        <li>Freelancers and consultants</li>
                        <li>Commission-based sales professionals</li>
                        <li>Gig economy workers</li>
                        <li>Multiple income stream earners</li>
                        <li>Seasonal workers with irregular income</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>What You'll Need</h2>
                    <p>Self-employed mortgages require more documentation than traditional applications, but I'll walk you through exactly what's needed. Typically, this includes:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Two years of personal tax returns (T1 Generals)</li>
                        <li>Notice of Assessments from CRA</li>
                        <li>Business financial statements or T2s (if incorporated)</li>
                        <li>12-24 months of bank statements</li>
                        <li>Proof of business registration or articles of incorporation</li>
                        <li>Sometimes: a letter from your accountant</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Don't worry if this seems like a lot—I'll give you a clear checklist and help you gather everything.</p>

                    <h2>The Trade-Off</h2>
                    <p>I'll be honest with you: self-employed mortgages sometimes come with slightly higher rates than traditional financing. The lender is taking on a bit more perceived risk, and they price accordingly.</p>
                    <p>However, the difference is often smaller than people expect. And for many self-employed clients, a slightly higher rate is far better than not getting approved at all—or not being able to buy the home you actually want.</p>
                    <p>I'll always show you all your options and explain the trade-offs clearly so you can make an informed decision.</p>

                    <h2>Been Declined Before?</h2>
                    <p>If a bank has already turned you down, don't give up. Banks have rigid criteria and limited options. I have access to lenders they don't even know about—lenders who specialize in exactly your situation.</p>
                    <p>A decline from one lender doesn't mean you can't get a mortgage. It might just mean you were talking to the wrong lender.</p>
